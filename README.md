# Landing-page
Author:Clifford Morara.
The page is a portfolio landing page of my project. I intend to create a website that I would display information about myself, what I have achieved so far and where I want to be in the next few years.
I have included my services in the page and my contacts, in any case one should ever require my services, he/she should feel free to reach out to me.
The page only defines the main project of what I want to create.
The website does not need any special access in order to access it, not even a code is required, once u have the live link, you are set to go. Paste in on the google site and it will bring you to my page, where you can view my information and services I offer. Feel free to make a call if You need the services.
