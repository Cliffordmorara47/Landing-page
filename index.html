            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm <strong>Clifford Morara.</strong> I joined Moringa school in the month of november, before that, I used to go for lessons at Cornerstone Training Institute, for computer repair and maintenance. I completed my High school in the year 2019, got a grade of B-plain, Was supposed to join East Africa School of aviation but on realising that it was a private school and my parents could not afford it, I decided to apply at Technical Universities of Kenya.</p>
            <p>While waiting for my request to be approved, a friend refferred me to the Moringa Access team and I decided to try my luck. I was picked for an interview and later on I was accepted to the school. That was when my course in life changed.</p>
            <p>I have always had a passion for technology since I was a kid, just seeing people use computers made me wish to know how to operate it. So when I was given a chance to pursue Software-Engineering at Moringa School, I was eager to take it and see what it had in store for me.</p>
            <p>I love listening to music and taking evening walks preferrably alone.</p>
